# How Yield is Generated for zheTOKENS

Zhenglong's high yields come from concentrating all the yield from the protocol's collateral into a smaller pool of active users.

- **Yield Concentration:** When you mint zheTOKENS (pegged tokens) and steamedTOKENS (leveraged tokens), your collateral is pooled. However, **only zheTOKENS deposited in the rebalance pool earn yield**.

- **Example:**
  Suppose there is $100 of collateral backing $50 of zheUSD and $50 of steamedETH.  
  If only $30 of zheUSD is deposited in the rebalance pool (and the rest is in wallets or liquidity pools), then that $30 is earning yield from the full $100 of collateral.  
  This means the rebalance pool can earn **3x the base yield**â€”so if the collateral earns 7% APR, the rebalance pool could see 20%+ APR.

- **Result:**

  - **zheTOKENS** in the rebalance pool earn a much higher APR than the underlying collateral.
  - **steamedTOKENS** benefit from the protocol's rebalancing and risk management, but do not earn yield directly.

- **Extra Boost:** On top of this, $STEAM incentives can further increase the yield for active participants.

> By concentrating all the yield from the protocol's collateral into the rebalance pool, Zhenglong delivers much higher APRs to active users than would be possible with the collateral alone.
