## Fees and Costs

### Trading Fees

- **Dynamic Fee Structure**

  - Fees are dynamically set based on market conditions and protocol health
  - ZHE token (pegged tokens) fees typically around 0.25% in normal conditions
  - STEAMED token (leverage tokens) fees typically around 1% in normal conditions
  - Fees can be adjusted lower, to zero, or even negative to incentivize certain behaviors (e.g., negative fees to increase demand for pegged token minting)

- **Variable Thresholds**

  - The UI will always inform you of the exact fee you will pay before transaction confirmation
  - Larger transactions may cross different fee thresholds
  - In these cases, fees are applied pro-rata
  - Example: If a $20,000 trade moves the market from 0.25% to 0.3% fee threshold, part of the trade will be executed at 0.25% and the remainder at 0.3%

- **Network Costs**
  - Gas fees for blockchain transactions
