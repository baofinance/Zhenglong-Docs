# Genesis Vaults

To launch new markets efficiently and fairly, Zhenglong uses **Genesis Vaults** — time-limited vaults that bootstrap liquidity, collateral backing, and community participation from day one.

Genesis Vaults are **the starting point** for every new synthetic market on Zhenglong.

## How Genesis Vaults Work

### 1. Users Deposit Collateral

- Participants deposit approved collateral (e.g., wstETH, ETH, USDC) into the Genesis Vault during the offering period
- The deposited collateral will form the initial backing of the new synthetic market
- Each Genesis Vault has a defined start and end date for participation

### 2. Receive New Tokens at Launch

At the end of the Genesis Vault period, participants receive:

- **Pegged Tokens (zheTokens)**: Synthetic assets pegged to the selected price feed (e.g., zheUSD)
- **Leverage Tokens (steamedTokens)**: Leveraged exposure tokens representing the residual collateral margin

The combined net asset value (NAV) of the issued tokens matches the value of the original collateral — meaning Genesis participants **retain their value**, but now split across two new tokens with different risk-return profiles.

### 3. Earn Additional Rewards

Genesis Vault participants are also rewarded with **STEAM tokens** to incentivize early support. This ensures that early adopters are well-compensated for helping bootstrap the protocol.

## Why Genesis Vaults Are Important

### Instant Market Liquidity

Genesis participants provide immediate collateral and token float for new markets, ensuring they are liquid and usable from launch.

### Balanced System Collateralization

The Genesis Vault design ensures that both the stable (pegged) side and the leveraged (steamed) side of the market are populated in healthy proportions.

### Low-Risk Entry

Participants in the Genesis Vault take minimal market risk:

- The total NAV of their pegged and leverage tokens equals their deposited collateral at launch
- They can choose to hold, trade, or stake their new tokens based on their individual risk appetite

### Community Ownership

Genesis Vaults enable a fair and decentralized distribution of new synthetic assets — without reliance on centralized market makers or whales.

## Example: wstETH Genesis Vault

Suppose Zhenglong launches a market for **wstETH collateralized against USD**.

During the Genesis period:

- Users deposit **wstETH** into the Genesis Vault
- After the Genesis closes, users receive:
  - **zheUSD**: A synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar
  - **steamedETHD**: A leveraged long token providing amplified exposure to ETH vs USD

Participants can:

- Hold zheUSD for stability and earn yield via Stability Pools
- Trade or hold steamedETH to speculate on ETH price appreciation
- Or sell or provide liquidity with either asset in DeFi

In addition, they earn **STEAM rewards** for participating early.
