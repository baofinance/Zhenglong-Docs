# STEAM Token Overview

**STEAM** is the native governance, incentive, and revenue-sharing token of the Zhenglong ecosystem. It plays a central role in coordinating the protocol's growth, securing market health, and rewarding community participation.

STEAM turns users, builders, and liquidity providers into long-term stakeholders aligned with Zhenglong's success through multiple utilities:

- Governance power through veSTEAM (vote-escrowed STEAM)
- Boosting rewards in Stability Pools and liquidity provision
- Protocol revenue sharing and redistribution
- Control over emissions and incentives via gauge voting
- Alignment of long-term interests with the protocol's success
