# STEAM Token Overview

**STEAM** is the native governance, incentive, and revenue-sharing token of the Zhenglong ecosystem. It plays a central role in coordinating the protocol's growth, securing market health, and rewarding community participation.

## Overview

STEAM turns users, builders, and liquidity providers into long-term stakeholders aligned with Zhenglong's success through multiple utilities:

- Governance power through veSTEAM (vote-escrowed STEAM)
- Boosting rewards in Stability Pools and liquidity provision
- Protocol revenue sharing and redistribution
- Control over emissions and incentives via gauge voting
- Alignment of long-term interests with the protocol's success

## Token Utilities

### 1. Governance Power (veSTEAM)

STEAM holders who lock their tokens as **veSTEAM** gain the ability to:

- Vote on new incentivized market launches
- Direct incentive emissions toward Stability Pools, liquidity pools, or strategic initiatives
- Influence protocol parameters like minimum collateral ratios and fee structures
- Direct protocol revenue
- Participate in gauge voting to determine where incentives flow

The longer the STEAM is locked, the more veSTEAM is received, and the greater the governance power.

### 2. Boosted Rewards

- veSTEAM holders receive **boosted returns** on Stability Pool deposits and liquidity provision
- Lock duration affects boost multipliers - longer locks provide greater benefits
- Enhance yields across all protocol participation
- Access premium features and advance governance weight

### 3. Revenue Sharing

- Portions of protocol revenue — including minting fees, redemption fees, and yield from yield-bearing collateral — are shared with veSTEAM lockers
- veSTEAM holders can vote on directing fee allocation
- Revenue increases with protocol adoption and usage
- Provides sustainable, non-inflationary returns

### 4. Gauge Voting System

- Governance is conducted through a **gauge voting model**
- veSTEAM holders vote on how emissions are distributed across different Stability Pools and markets
- Dynamically allocates incentives based on community priorities and market demand
- Enables flexible adaptation to changing market conditions
