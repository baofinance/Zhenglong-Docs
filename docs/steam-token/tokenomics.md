# STEAM Tokenomics

Zhenglong is built to reward long-term participation, decentralize governance, and create sustainable liquidity incentives. All token allocations are transparently structured and time-released.

**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 $STEAM

## 🔒 Locked Governance Supply

The Bao Treasury and FX Protocol Allocation are both committed to permanent max lock as veSTEAM once vested.

These make up a minimum of **28% of the token supply** that is guaranteed to be locked and actively contributing to protocol governance and emission direction.

_On the chart, this is shown as an overlay line labeled:_

> 🟢 Minimum locked as veSTEAM (Bao + FX Protocol)

## 📉 Emissions Logic

**Protocol Incentives (39%)**

- Year 1: 5,000,000 tokens emitted linearly
- Following years: each emits 12.9% less than the year before
- Modeled after Curve's emissions: decaying emissions with a long tail
- Emission lifespan: 100+ years

**veBAO Airdrops (5%)**

- Year 1: 500,000 tokens (linear)
- Each subsequent year emits 10% less than the year before
- Also spans 100+ years
- Designed to reward long-term aligned governance holders

## 📊 STEAM 5 Year Emissions

This chart shows:

- 📦 Cumulative token release over the first 5 years
- 🟩 Stacked areas for each allocation category
- 🔒 An overlay line for the minimum number of max-locked veSTEAM tokens from the Bao and FX Protocol allocations

The categories with immediate or early liquidity — IDO, Initial Liquidity, and Genesis — appear at the base for clarity.

_All values are linear unless stated otherwise. No cliffs. No surprise unlocks._
