# Governance & veSTEAM

## Token Utilities

### 1. Governance Power (veSTEAM)

STEAM holders who lock their tokens as **veSTEAM** gain the ability to:

- Vote on new incentivized market launches
- Direct incentive emissions toward Stability Pools, liquidity pools, or strategic initiatives
- Influence protocol parameters like minimum collateral ratios and fee structures
- Direct protocol revenue
- Participate in gauge voting to determine where incentives flow

The longer the STEAM is locked, the more veSTEAM is received, and the greater the governance power.

### 2. Boosted Rewards

- veSTEAM holders receive **boosted returns** on Stability Pool deposits and liquidity provision
- Lock duration affects boost multipliers - longer locks provide greater benefits
- Enhance yields across all protocol participation
- Access premium features and advance governance weight

### 3. Revenue Sharing

- Portions of protocol revenue — including minting fees, redemption fees, and yield from yield-bearing collateral — are shared with veSTEAM lockers
- veSTEAM holders can vote on directing fee allocation
- Revenue increases with protocol adoption and usage
- Provides sustainable, non-inflationary returns

### 4. Gauge Voting System

- Governance is conducted through a **gauge voting model**
- veSTEAM holders vote on how emissions are distributed across different Stability Pools and markets
- Dynamically allocates incentives based on community priorities and market demand
- Enables flexible adaptation to changing market conditions

## Locking STEAM for veSTEAM

- **Maximum Lock Duration**: 1 year (12 months) is the maximum lock period
- **Linear veSTEAM Calculation**: The amount of veSTEAM you receive increases linearly based on your lock length:
  - 3 months lock = 0.25 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 6 months lock = 0.5 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 9 months lock = 0.75 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 12 months lock = 1 veSTEAM per locked STEAM (maximum)
- **Voting Power**: Longer locks grant proportionally higher voting power and greater share of rewards
- **Decaying Locks**: Lock time gradually decreases over time unless renewed
- **Alignment Incentives**: Users who lock STEAM align their interests with the long-term health and growth of Zhenglong

### veSTEAM Lock Duration

The relationship between lock duration and veSTEAM received is directly proportional. Locking for the maximum duration of 12 months provides the maximum benefit of 1 veSTEAM per STEAM locked.
