# Governance & veSTEAM

## Locking STEAM for veSTEAM

- **Maximum Lock Duration**: 1 year (12 months) is the maximum lock period
- **Linear veSTEAM Calculation**: The amount of veSTEAM you receive increases linearly based on your lock length:
  - 3 months lock = 0.25 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 6 months lock = 0.5 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 9 months lock = 0.75 veSTEAM per locked STEAM
  - 12 months lock = 1 veSTEAM per locked STEAM (maximum)
- **Voting Power**: Longer locks grant proportionally higher voting power and greater share of rewards
- **Decaying Locks**: Lock time gradually decreases over time unless renewed
- **Alignment Incentives**: Users who lock STEAM align their interests with the long-term health and growth of Zhenglong

### veSTEAM Lock Duration

The relationship between lock duration and veSTEAM received is directly proportional. Locking for the maximum duration of 12 months provides the maximum benefit of 1 veSTEAM per STEAM locked.
