# Supercharged Yield. Smarter Leverage.

Let's be real: synthetic assets sound powerful. But most of them? Clunky, brittle, overly complicated — and definitely not paying your bills.

**Zhenglong changes that.**

We're bringing groundbreaking yields to places they've never reached: BTC, ETH, and soon... anything with a price feed.

- **No loans. No debt spirals.**
- **No forced liquidations.**
- **Just hot, yield-bearing tokens that steam your assets instead of boiling them away.**

## 🍱 What Is Zhenglong?

Zhenglong is a synthetic asset protocol that transforms your favorite yield-bearing collateral — like fxSAVE or wstETH — into two powerful asset types:

- **zheTOKENS:** Pegged tokens (e.g., zheETH, zheBTC) that track a price feed and can earn **20%+ APR** on ETH, BTC, and more — a first in DeFi.
- **steamedTOKENS:** Rebalancing variable leverage tokens for directional plays, with no funding fees, no margin calls, and automatic risk rebalancing.

**Anywhere with a price feed, yield is coming.**

> Zhenglong brings yield to places it's never reached.  
> Steamed fresh. Composable. Community-powered.

## Core Components

### zheTOKENS (Pegged Assets)

- Synthetic assets pegged 1:1 to reference prices via reliable oracle feeds
- Examples: zheUSD (USD), zheBTC (Bitcoin), zheTSLA (Tesla stock)
- Fully collateralized and redeemable
- Freely usable across DeFi platforms
- Designed to maintain tight pegs through arbitrage and protocol rebalancing
- **Earn amplified yield by concentrating all protocol collateral yield into active stakers**

### steamedTOKENS (Rebalancing Leverage Tokens)

- Variable leverage tokens representing residual claims on collateral
- Similar to holding liquidation-protected leveraged positions
- Absorb volatility to protect zheToken stability
- No forced liquidations or margin calls
- Rebalanced automatically during market stress
- **Directional exposure on any asset with a price feed**

### Stability Pools

- Two types: Collateral Pools and Steamed Pools
- Maintain system solvency through automated rebalancing
- Earn yield from yield bearing collateral (e.g. stETH)
- Earn STEAM incentives
- Transform market downturns, or pegged token price spikes into opportunities for participants

### Genesis Vaults

- Bootstrap new markets
- Minimal risk
- Provide immediate liquidity and collateral backing
- Distribute both zheTokens and steamedTokens to participants
- STEAM (or other) incentives for participants
