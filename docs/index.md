# Welcome to Zhenglong

Welcome to the official documentation for Zhenglong - a decentralized platform for creating and trading synthetic assets.

## What is Zhenglong?

**Zhenglong** is a decentralized platform for creating and trading synthetic assets â€“ tokens that mirror the value of real-world or digital assets without needing direct custody of those assets. It introduces a novel **three-token model** with **100% collateral efficiency**:

- **Collateral Tokens**: Yield-bearing assets that back the system (e.g., stETH)
- **ZHE Tokens (Pegged Assets)**: Synthetic tokens that track prices of various assets 1:1
- **STEAMED Tokens (Leverage Tokens)**: Tokens that offer protected leverage exposure

The protocol allows users to trade collateral assets to mint **pegged tokens** or **leveraged tokens** with **100% collateral efficiency**. Pegged tokens can track currencies, cryptocurrencies, stocks, or anything with a reliable price feed, while leverage tokens absorb volatility and offer a long position on collateral vs the pegged token.

To ensure stability, Zhenglong employs on-chain **Stability Pools** that automatically rebalance the protocol, maintaining system solvency without reliance on off-chain liquidators.

## Key Features

- **Three-Token Model**: Efficiently split risk between stability-seeking and risk-seeking users
- **Stability Pools**: Maintain system solvency and offer yield opportunities
- **Genesis Vaults**: Bootstrap new markets with fair token distribution
- **STEAM Token**: Governance, incentives, and revenue-sharing
- **100% Collateral Efficiency**: Maximize capital utilization
- **Protected Leverage**: No liquidations or margin calls
- **Real Yield**: Earn returns from yield-bearing collateral

## Quick Start

1. **Connect Your Wallet**

   - Visit [app.zhenglong.xyz](https://app.zhenglong.xyz)
   - Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

2. **Choose Your Strategy**

   - Deposit into stability pools for yield and protocol security
   - Mint or trade ZHE tokens for stable 1:1 exposure
   - Acquire STEAMED tokens for leveraged exposure without liquidation risk
   - Participate in Genesis Vaults to bootstrap new markets

3. **Start Earning**
   - Earn yield from collateral in stability pools
   - Receive STEAM rewards for protocol participation
   - Lock STEAM for veSTEAM to boost rewards and participate in governance

## Core Components

### ZHE Tokens (Pegged Assets)

- Synthetic assets pegged 1:1 to reference prices via reliable oracle feeds
- Examples: zheUSD (USD), zheBTC (Bitcoin), zheTSLA (Tesla stock)
- Fully collateralized and redeemable
- Freely usable across DeFi platforms
- Designed to maintain tight pegs through arbitrage and protocol rebalancing

### STEAMED Tokens (Leverage Tokens)

- Variable leverage tokens representing residual claims on collateral
- Similar to holding liquidation-protected leveraged positions
- Absorb volatility to protect zheToken stability
- No forced liquidations or margin calls
- Rebalanced automatically during market stress

### Stability Pools

- Two types: Collateral Pools and Steamed Pools
- Maintain system solvency through automated rebalancing
- Earn yield from yield bearing collateral (e.g. stETH)
- Earn STEAM incentives
- Transform market downturns, or pegged token price spikes into opportunities for participants

### Genesis Vaults

- Bootstrap new markets
- Minimal risk
- Provide immediate liquidity and collateral backing
- Distribute both zheTokens and steamedTokens to participants
- STEAM (or other) incentives for participants
